  intro:
    - Software Introduction
    - This is a tool for quickly drawing topological graphs based on the Tauri framework,
      which can be used for project topology diagram drawing and rapid brainstorming
      drafts.
    - Xmind can only be used to draw tree structure diagrams, while FigJam and draw.io
      can be used for drawing but they are a bit slow to open as web pages.
    - Therefore, this small software was created.

    - We are committed to designing the fastest and most convenient methodology for
      "graph theory" and are also exploring and innovating in the fields of visual thinking
      and topological todo lists.

  autoSaveWhenClose:
    title: Automatically save the project file when clicking the close button in the
      upper right corner of the window
    description: |
      When you close the software, if there are unsaved project files, a prompt will appear asking if you want to save.
      With this option enabled, the project file will be saved automatically when you close the software.
      Therefore, it is recommended to enable this option.
  autoSave:
    title: Enable Auto Save
    description: |
      Automatically saves the current file.
      This feature currently only works for files with existing paths and does not work for draft files!
  autoSaveInterval:
    title: Auto Save Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Note: Currently, the timer only counts when the software window is active and does not count when the software is minimized.
  autoBackup:
    title: Enable Auto Backup
    description: |
      Automatically backs up the current file.
      An automatic backup will be created next to the project file.
      If it is a draft, it will be stored in the specified path.
  autoBackupInterval:
    title: Auto Backup Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Too frequent automatic backups may generate a large number of backup files,
      which will take up disk space.
  autoBackupDraftPath:
    title: Automatic backup folder path for drafts
    description: |
      Please enter the absolute path. Drafts will be backed up to this folder.
      If left blank or the path is incorrect, no backup will be performed.
      For Windows systems, please use backslashes.
      For example: C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\DraftBackup
      Do not include a path separator at the end.
  scaleExponent:
    title: View Scaling Speed
    description: |
      The "current scale" will continuously approach the "target scale" at a certain rate.
      When the approximation is close enough (less than 0.0001), the scaling will stop automatically.
      A value of 1 means the scaling will be completed immediately without any intermediate transition effect.
      A value of 0 means the scaling will never be completed, which can simulate a locked effect.
  scaleCameraByMouseLocation:
    title: Scale Camera by Mouse Location
    description: |
      When enabled, the center of the camera scaling will be the position of the mouse
      When disabled, the center of the camera scaling will be the center of the current view
  allowMoveCameraByWSAD:
    title: Allow camera movement with W S A D keys
    description: |
      When enabled, you can use the W S A D keys to move the camera up, down, left, and right.
      When disabled, you can only use the mouse to move the camera, avoiding the endless scroll bug.
  cameraKeyboardMoveReverse:
    title: Reverse Camera Movement with Keyboard
    description: |
      When enabled, the direction of camera movement using the W S A D keys will be reversed
      The original movement logic was to move the camera floating on the screen, but some users interpreted it as moving the canvas, which caused confusion
      Therefore, this option was introduced
  allowAddCycleEdge:
    title: Allow adding self-loops between nodes
    description: |
      When enabled, self-loops can be added between nodes, allowing a node to connect to itself, which is useful for state machine drawings.
      Disabled by default, as it is rarely used and may easily trigger accidental actions.
  moveAmplitude:
    title: View Movement Acceleration
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The camera can be considered as a hovering aircraft that can spray in four directions.
      This acceleration value represents the size of the jet's power and needs to be adjusted with the friction setting below to adjust the speed.
  moveFriction:
    title: View Movement Friction Coefficient
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the sliding distance, and the smaller the friction coefficient, the larger the sliding distance.
      A value of 0 means absolutely smooth.
  gamepadDeadzone:
    title: Gamepad Deadzone
    description: |
      This setting is used when using a gamepad to control the view.
      The input value of the gamepad is between 0 and 1. The smaller this value, the more sensitive the gamepad input.
      The larger the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to 0 or 1, and there will not be too much change.
      The smaller the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to the middle value, and there will be a larger change.

  intro:
  - Software Introduction
  - This is a tool based on the Tauri framework for quickly drawing node diagrams,
    which can be used for project topology diagrams and quick brainstorming drafts
  - Xmind can only be used to draw tree-structured diagrams. FigJam and draw.io can
    be used, but the web pages load a bit slowly
  - That's why this software was created

  - Contact Us
  - We are committed to designing the fastest and most convenient drawing methodology
    for "graph theory" and also exploring innovations in visual thinking and topological
    to-do lists.
  - "If you want to get quick feedback, provide suggestions, or have any ideas or

  entityDetailsWidthLimit:
    title: Entity Details Width Limit
    description: |
      Limits the maximum width of entity details. Excess content will be wrapped to the next line.
  limitCameraInCycleSpace:
    title: Enable Camera Movement Limit in Cycle Space
    description: |
      When enabled, the camera can only move within a rectangular area.
      This prevents the camera from moving too far and getting lost.
      The rectangular area forms a cycle space, similar to the map in the game "Snake," 
      where moving to the top will bring you to the bottom, and moving to the left will bring you to the right.
      Note: This feature is still in the experimental stage.
  cameraCycleSpaceSizeX:
    title: Cycle Space Width
    description: |
      The width of the cycle space, measured in pixels.
  cameraCycleSpaceSizeY:
    title: Cycle Space Height
    description: |

  renderEffect:
    title: Render Effects
    description: Whether to render effects. If experiencing lag, this can be disabled
  historySize:
    title: History Size
    description: |
      This value determines the maximum number of times you can undo using Ctrl+Z.
      If your computer has very limited memory, you can reduce this value.
  textIntegerLocationAndSizeRender:
    title: Text Integer Position and Size Rendering
    description: |
      When enabled, all text sizes and positions will be integers to save rendering performance.
      However, this may cause text jittering. It is recommended to use this with a zoom speed of 1.
      If your computer is very laggy, especially when zooming and panning, you can enable this option.
  isPauseRenderWhenManipulateOvertime:
    title: Pause rendering if the stage has not been operated for a certain period
      of time
    description: |
      When enabled, rendering will pause after a certain number of seconds without stage manipulation to save CPU/GPU resources.
  renderOverTimeWhenNoManipulateTime:
    title: Time to Stop Rendering Stage When Idle (Seconds)
    description: |
      Rendering will stop after a certain number of seconds without stage manipulation to save CPU/GPU resources.
      This will only take effect if the "Pause Rendering When Idle" option is enabled.
  ignoreTextNodeTextRenderLessThanCameraScale:
    title: Ignore Text Node Text Rendering When Camera Scale is Less Than a Certain
      Value
    description: |
      When enabled, text within text nodes will not be rendered when the camera scale is less than a certain value (i.e., when observing the macro view).
      This can improve rendering performance but will make the text content of text nodes invisible.
  isEnableEntityCollision:
    title: Enable Entity Collision Detection
    description: |
      When enabled, entities will collide and squeeze each other, which may affect performance.
      It is recommended to disable this option, as entity collision and squeezing are not yet perfect and may cause stack overflow.
  autoNamerTemplate:
    title: Auto-Naming Template
    description: |
      Input `{{i}}` to automatically replace the node name with a number, which will increment automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      For example, `n{{i}}` will be replaced with `n1`, `n2`, `n3`...
      Input `{{date}}` to automatically replace with the current date, which will update automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      Input `{{time}}` to automatically replace with the current time, which will update automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      These can be combined, such as `{{i}}-{{date}}-{{time}}`.
  autoNamerSectionTemplate:
    title: Auto-Naming Group Template
    description: |
      Input `{{i}}` to automatically replace the node name with a number, which will increment automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      For example, `n{{i}}` will be replaced with `n1`, `n2`, `n3`...
      Input `{{date}}` to automatically replace with the current date, which will update automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      Input `{{time}}` to automatically replace with the current time, which will update automatically when creating by double-clicking.
      These can be combined, such as `{{i}}-{{date}}-{{time}}`.
  autoSaveWhenClose:
    title: Auto-Save When Closing
    description: |
      When closing the software, if there are unsaved project files, a prompt will appear asking whether to save.
      Enabling this option will automatically save project files when closing the software.
      It is recommended to enable this option.
  autoSave:
    title: Enable Auto-Save
    description: |
      Automatically save the current file.
      This feature currently only works for files with a specified path and does not apply to draft files!
  autoSaveInterval:
    title: Auto-Save Interval (Seconds)
    description: |
      Note: The timer only counts when the software window is active and will not count when the software is minimized.
  autoBackup:
    title: Enable Auto-Backup
    description: |
      Automatically back up the current file.
      Auto-backup will create a copy next to the project file.
      If it is a draft, it will be stored in the specified path.
  autoBackupInterval:
    title: Auto-Backup Interval (Seconds)
    description: |
      Too frequent auto-backups may generate a large number of backup files, 
      which can occupy disk space.
  autoBackupDraftPath:
    title: Auto-Backup Path for Drafts
    description: |
      Please enter an absolute path. Drafts will be backed up to this folder.
      If the path is empty or incorrect, no backup will be performed.
      For Windows systems, use backslashes.
      For example: C:\Users\username\Documents\DraftBackup
      Do not end with a path separator.
  scaleExponent:
    title: Zoom Speed
    description: |
      The current zoom level will continuously approach the target zoom level at a certain rate.
      When it gets close enough (less than 0.0001), it will automatically stop zooming.
      A value of 1 means the zoom will be immediate with no transition effect.
      A value of 0 means the zoom will never complete and can simulate a locked effect.
      Note: If you experience lag while zooming, set this to 1.
  cameraKeyboardScaleRate:
    title: Keyboard Zoom Rate
    description: |
      The zoom rate of the viewport when using a key press.
      A value of 0.2 means each zoom in will multiply the scale by 1.2, and each zoom out will multiply it by 0.8.
      A value of 0 disables keyboard zooming.
  scaleCameraByMouseLocation:
    title: Zoom Based on Mouse Position
    description: |
      When enabled, the center of the zoom will be the mouse position.
      When disabled, the center of the zoom will be the center of the current viewport.
  allowMoveCameraByWSAD:
    title: Allow Moving Camera with W S A D Keys
    description: |
      When enabled, you can move the viewport using the W S A D keys.
      When disabled, you can only move the viewport using the mouse, which prevents infinite scrolling bugs.
  cameraFollowsSelectedNodeOnArrowKeys:
    title: Follow Selected Node with Arrow Keys
    description: |
      When enabled, the viewport will follow when switching selected nodes using the arrow keys.
  cameraKeyboardMoveReverse:
    title: Reverse Camera Movement with Keyboard
    description: |
      When enabled, the movement direction of the W S A D keys will be reversed.
      The original movement logic is to move the camera floating on the screen, but if it is considered moving the stage, it is reversed.
      Hence, this option is provided.
  cameraResetViewPaddingRate:
    title: Padding Rate When Resetting View Based on Selected Nodes
    description: |
      When you select a group of nodes or a single node and press a shortcut key or click a button to reset the viewport,
      the viewport will adjust its size and position to ensure all selected content is centered on the screen and fully visible.
      Due to zoom level adjustments, there may be some padding around the edges.
      A value of 1 means no padding at all (very close-up view).
      A value of 2 means the padding is exactly one times the content size.
  allowAddCycleEdge:
    title: Allow Adding Self-Loops Between Nodes
    description: |
      When enabled, nodes can have self-loops, i.e., connections to themselves, which is useful for state machine diagrams.
      This is disabled by default because it is not commonly used and can be easily triggered by mistake.
  moveAmplitude:
    title: Camera Movement Amplitude
    description: |
      This setting is used when moving the viewport using the W S A D keys.
      Think of the camera as a hovering aircraft that can thrust in four directions.
      This amplitude value represents the power of the thrust, which needs to be adjusted in combination with the friction setting below.
  moveFriction:
    title: Camera Movement Friction Coefficient
    description: |
      This setting is used when moving the viewport using the W S A D keys.
      The higher the friction coefficient, the shorter the sliding distance.
      A value of 0 represents absolute smoothness.
  gamepadDeadzone:
    title: Gamepad Dead Zone
    description: |
      This setting is used when controlling the viewport with a gamepad.
      The input value of the gamepad ranges from 0 to 1. The smaller this value, the more sensitive the gamepad input will be.
      A larger dead zone means the input will tend more towards 0 or 1 with less variation.
      A smaller dead zone means the input will tend more towards the middle value with greater variation.
  mouseRightDragBackground:
    title: Right-Click Drag Background Operation
    options:
      cut: Cut and Delete Objects
      moveCamera: Move Viewport
  doubleClickMiddleMouseButton:
    title: Double-Click Middle Mouse Button
    description: |
      The action performed when the scroll wheel is quickly pressed twice. By default, it resets the viewport.
      Disabling this option can prevent accidental triggers.
    options:
      adjustCamera: Adjust Viewport
      none: No Operation

  textNodeSelectAllWhenStartEditByMouseClick:
    title: Select All Text When Starting Edit by Mouse Click
    description: |
      When enabled, all text content will be selected when starting to edit a text node.
      If you usually want to change the entire content when editing, enable this option.
      If you are more likely to append content, disable this option.
  textNodeSelectAllWhenStartEditByKeyboard:

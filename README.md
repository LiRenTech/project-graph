# üåç Help us translate!

[![Weblate Badge]][Weblate]

Project Graph is an open-source project that aims to provide a next-generation node diagram tool for visual thinking. We need your help to translate the app into different languages.

---

**Draw fast, think efficiently** ‚Äî Unleash creativity and streamline workflows with AI-powered graph design.

## üöÄ Features

- **Blazing-Fast Drawing**  
  Create complex node diagrams in seconds with drag-and-drop simplicity. Optimized with Tauri framework for seamless performance, even with thousands of nodes.

- **AI-Powered Intelligence**  
  Auto-generate tree structures and suggest node relationships using integrated large language models (e.g., ChatGPT), accelerating brainstorming and system design.

- **Dynamic Compute Engine**  
  Analyze dependencies, optimize paths, and derive logic trees in real time through a powerful graph engine.

- **Cross-Platform & Multi-Modal**  
  Native support for Windows, Linux, and experimental macOS/Android builds. Export diagrams as PNG, SVG, or JSON for diverse use cases.

- **Open Ecosystem**  
  Built with React and ~~extensible APIs~~ (WIP). MIT-licensed for unlimited customization.

---

## üì• Installation

Refer to [Documentation](https://project-graph.top/installation)

**System Requirements**:

- Windows 10+ (Edge WebView2)
- Linux (webkit2gtk, gtk)
- _macOS support in development_

## üéÆ Quick Start

1. **Create Nodes**: Double-click canvas to add nodes.
2. **Edit Content**: Double-click nodes to rename; Ctrl+double-click for descriptions.
3. **Connect Nodes**: Right-drag between nodes to create links.
4. **Extend Node with AI**: Click "AI" button to generate child nodes with suggested relationships.

For advanced features like compute engine, see [Full Documentation](https://project-graph.top).

## üõ† Technical Highlights

- **Architecture**: Tauri-based desktop app with Rust backend for maximum performance.
- ~~**AI Integration**: Leverage LLMs for context-aware diagram generation and knowledge graph enhancement.~~ (WIP)
- ~~**Real-Time Collaboration**: Sync edits across teams via shared project files or Git integration.~~ (WIP)
